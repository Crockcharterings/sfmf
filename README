Sailfish OS Factory Snapshot Update
===================================

This is a collection of tools that can turn an extracted factory image
directory tree into a SFMF archive file that is optimized for re-using
existing binary blobs on a device to minimize download bandwidth while
still being able to restore the snapshot even in case blobs have been
modified in the live system (this also allows full recovery from an
empty partition, if this is needed).


Dependencies on the host (for create-tarball.py):

 - Root permissions (for loop-mounting the btrfs image)
 - Python 2.7
 - Kernel with btrfs support + btrfs utilities installed
 - simg2img from Android
